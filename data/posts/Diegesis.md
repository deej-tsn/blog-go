### Tell me about yourself

"I’ve always been drawn to problem-solving. As a child, I loved completing puzzles and dismantling toys to see how they worked, and then trying to put them back together. When I was introduced to technology, computers became my primary outlet for exploring the world of problem-solving through programming.

Since then I graduated with a Master's in Discrete Maths from the University of Warwick. This formal education deepened my understanding of computers, programming, and the underlying logic they operate on. Since graduating, I’ve focused on modern approaches to large-scale applications, including system design and user authentication implementations. I make it a point to apply the knowledge I gain to new projects and have created a personal website to showcase my work and skills in real-world applications.

Ultimately, I am a passionate software engineer eager for opportunities to learn and excel in this field. I am excited about the prospect of contributing my problem-solving skills, academic background, and hands-on experience to innovative projects, and I look forward to continuing my professional growth."
